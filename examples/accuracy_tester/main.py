        # Currently implemented functions that will be tested
        # This program performs a number of accuracy tests against the library. THey are:
        # 1. Each individual parser is tested
        #   a. Are the subject, verb, object, and prepositional phrases properly identified?
        #   b. Are the applicability score and the reliability score properly calculated?
        #   c. Are all of the patterns identified?
        # 2. All 3 parsers in one function call
        #   a. Are all of the patterns identified?
        #   b. Are the subject, verb, object, and prepositional phrases properly identified?
        #   c. Are the applicability score and the reliability score properly calculated?

        # Functions to be implemented that will be tested
        # 1. FreqDist to determine the possible topics that all fo the strings relate to
        # 2. Topics for each pattern is correctly identified
