# Accuracy Tester

The accuracy tester is both an example and a client. It can be called by the user, however, it only generates data about the current state of the library and how accurate it is. This is done by comparing the result of a test set and the known result of that set. This will allow the library's weak points to be identified and "bolstered" in future releases.
