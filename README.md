# regex4dummies
A pattern finder for strings, implemented in Python.

regex4dummies was made for lazy people! It allows you to easily parse strings and find simple and complex patterns. In fact, one of the key features of regex4dummies is that the library will automatically find patterns if you give it a mandatory word or phrase to look for. This can be a keyword or something more complex.
