# Docs

The Docs folder contains a downloadable version of the wiki.

## How to download

To download the docs for regex4dummies, either download the entire repository or download the compressed folder named docs in the most recent release ( which can be found on the release section of this Github repository )

## Others ways to view

If you would like to view the docs, simply move to the wiki part of this site and navigate throughout the pages to find whatever you are looking for.

A website containing all of the docs in an easier-to-view display is in the works. Please check back here for further information that will become available as time goes on.
