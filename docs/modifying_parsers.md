# Modifying Currently-Included Parsers

If you need to modify a parser, this can be easily accomplished by editing the source code of the file in question.

- If you are going to edit the literal parser, after cding to the regex4dummies folder within the outermost folder, open the literal_parsing.py file. The code should be pretty straight forward, and can be easily changed to suit whatever you would like it to accomplish.
- If you are going to edit the semantic parsers, open the semantic_parsing.py file. This file is a little more complicated, but should still be simple enough to quickly understand. Simply mess around with it until you understand what does what.


The comments contained within each file should help new people better understand how the code fits together.
