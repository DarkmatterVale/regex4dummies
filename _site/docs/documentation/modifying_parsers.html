If you need to modify a parser, this can be easily accomplished by editing the source code of the file in question.
<br><br>
- If you are going to edit the literal parser, after cding to the regex4dummies folder within the outermost folder, open the literal_parsing.py file. The code should be pretty straight forward, and can be easily changed to suit whatever you would like it to accomplish.
<br>- If you are going to edit the semantic parsers, open the semantic_parsing.py file. This file is a little more complicated, but should still be simple enough to quickly understand. Simply mess around with it until you understand what does what.
<br><br>
The comments contained within each file should help new people better understand how the code fits together.
